Machine learning cannot be loosely defined
	Describe -> Explain -> Predict - hidden state
	Geo side of the tree structure needs to be defined, but likely structured similar to biology
		There is an interface ontology that hasn't been defined yet (this is our opportunity)
			How are these functions affordances for life process. 
				Process based facets for each interaction
Draft combo venn + hive diagram with geo/bio/time - use as a legend


Example:

Crane Fly:
	Larvae
	Pupae
	Adult
		Reproduction
		Bio: Wing to Mass ration
		Geo: Substrate, Water Availablility & Stream Type (riffle/pool/bank)
